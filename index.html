      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm 20 years old, and I’ve always had a passion for computers. My dad worked in the tech industry so I was already predisposed to computers and tech for pretty much as long as I can remember. After I graduated High School I knew I wanted to work with computers, but I didn’t know if I wanted to do something more software oriented or hardware oriented. So I took an IT training class which taught me how to troubleshoot and repair computers and work with computer hardware. I then spent some time interning at a computer repair shop. I learned a lot during my time as an IT student, but I ultimately decided it wasn’t for me and that I would instead prefer to pursue a career in software development. During the 2020 pandemic, I used resources such as CodeAcademy to teach myself a little bit about coding, before deciding to commit to a coding bootcamp in 2021, and am now working towards accomplishing my long term goal of becoming a software developer.</p>
